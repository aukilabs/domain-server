# Domain Server

The Domain Server is responsible for storing poses of portals in domains and spatial domain data such as scene reconstructions and occupancy maps.

Every server needs a unique wallet to participate in the [posemesh economy](https://www.aukilabs.com/posemesh/fundamentals).

## Operation Mode
- Public: anyone can save data to your server. Auki Labs and the community are running public servers that anyone can use. You can find all servers on the Posemesh Console's `Domain Servers` page.
- Dedicated: only people from your organization can save their data to your server, but anyone will be able to read.

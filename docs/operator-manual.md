# Server Operator's Manual

While we at Auki Labs run several Domain servers in multiple regions on AWS, we allow anyone to become a Domain server operator and help us run part of the posemesh infrastructure.

Server operators stake $AUKI tokens and receive weekly token rewards for participating in the network. At a later stage, we plan to reward operators based on the number of domains hosted and amount of traffic served. See the current staking and reward policy in the [posemesh console](https://console.posemesh.org/) or in Auki's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/aukiverse).

If you have spare compute resources, meet the [minimum requirements](minimum-requirements.md), and wish to become a Domain server operator, please see the [video tutorial](video-tutorial.md) or [deployment methods](deployment.md) for instructions on how to get started.

If you are running into problems, you can report them as [issues](https://github.com/aukilabs/domain-server/issues) here on GitHub or talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/aukiverse).

**It is important that your server is running 24/7 without interruption. When a Domain server goes offline, domains hosted on it will be inaccessible and that domain data may even be lost forever, leading to very poor user experience. Thus servers that are unreliable will be delisted and will not be able to host more domains.**
